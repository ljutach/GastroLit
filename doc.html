        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p class="drop-cap">Welcome to the <b>GastroLit Documentation</b>. This page provides information on the project's themes, design choices, and how they influence the user experience.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Theme Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="drop-cap">GastroLit offers four distinct themes, each crafted to immerse users in a peculiar visual experience. These themes are more than just aesthetic variations: they transform the way content is perceived, enhancing the storytelling and cultural depth of the project. Designed to follow a chronological progression, the themes guide users through different historical and stylistic periods. Manuscripta evokes the rich textures of medieval manuscripts, Futurism embraces the bold typographic innovations of the early 20th century avant-garde, Cyberpunk channels the neon-drenched digital aesthetics of the 1980s and Futuristic envisions a sleek, high-tech design inspired by speculative sci-fi worlds. Each theme invites users to explore Italian literary gastronomy through a curated stylistic lens, connecting past, present, and imagined futures.</p>

        <hr>

Inspired by the aged elegance of medieval scriptoriums, this theme transports you to a time when scribes meticulously transcribed knowledge onto richly decorated scrolls and codices.</p>
