        "description": "Forese Donati (ca. 1250–1296) was a prominent Florentine poet and a contemporary of Dante Alighieri. A member of the powerful Donati family, Forese is best remembered for his connection to Dante, particularly through their lively poetic exchange known as the tenzone. This series of satirical and humorous poems showcased their wit and skill with language. Later immortalized in Dante’s Divine Comedy, Forese appears in the Purgatorio (Canto XXIII) among the Gluttonous, where he repents for his earthly excesses. Despite his personal flaws, Dante portrays Forese with a sense of affection and camaraderie, reflecting their enduring friendship.",
