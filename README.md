# GastroLit

GastroLit bridges the worlds of food, culture, and literature, immersing you in the gastronomic landscapes of Tuscany and Sicilyâ€”two regions rich in both culinary and literary heritage. Through carefully curated selections, we explore the works of Dante, Boccaccio, and Sacchetti in Tuscany, and Camilleri, Tomasi di Lampedusa, and Torregrossa in Sicily, unveiling the iconic food references that shape their narratives.

Enhance your reading experience by choosing from four unique typographic and layout themes, each inspired by a distinct stylistic tradition. Navigate the cultural and literary landscapes with our interactive map, which geolocates the places mentioned in the texts, bringing their historical and culinary significance to life. Dive into a world where storytelling and cuisine intertwine, offering a feast for both the mind and the senses.
